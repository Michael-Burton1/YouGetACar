Thursdayday 5-7:00 - tried to find a new API that dosen't hit a paywall after 10 calls, but decided to just make my own API and seed dummy data for the MVP.


I'm not sure if this is relivant, but I spent the entire day on wednesday trying to meet my mvp. I think it should be noted that from around 7pm until 12:00am I was working on functionallity to get and display spicific info for my app however I broke the code that I did have so I ended up reverting everything back to a quasi "working state for my presentation.
